Have you ever wondered why some colleagues always have countless ideas and bring interesting proposals to help the team keep evolving? Have you ever found yourself feeling frustrated in certain situations, wishing for constructive advice or opinions but ending up feeling helpless? This is where the concept of creative thinking comes into play, helping you achieve these objectives. To become a creative engineer with endless inspiration, you should train yourself in your daily work and even in your daily life.  

## Context

I still remember the first day I entered the company as a working student. At that time, the senior responsible for mentoring me initiated a game where we brainstormed ideas for projects suitable for working students. During the game, I was astonished by the unstoppable flow of ideas from his mind, and I was introduced to the world of creative thinking. In the following, I will describe some interesting yet useful tips for creative thinking. 

Let's get started! 

## Role Play (Simulation)

Stepping into another's shoes can open up a world of new perspectives. How would others approach the task? A child? An alien? Or a historical figure brought into the modern era? Role-playing stimulates our brains to think differently, encouraging novel solutions by simulating different roles and scenarios. The following three methods are frequently used by me as a software engineers to gain inspiration: 

### Imagine What God Would Do?

If you think from an omniscient and omnipotent perspective, you'll likely come up with an idea that feels impossible. Your next challenge is to bring that impossible idea to life, no matter how grandiose it might seem. Then, if you find it's still impossible, gradually add some realistic considerations and readapt it. Repeat the above steps, and you will arrive at a slightly unconventional but feasible idea. 

### AI Insights

**Interdisciplinary Approach**: When AI is blended with other fields, the results can be unexpectedly creative. By taking insights from AI solutions and merging them with human creativity, we can craft unique solutions.  
**Brainstorm from AI Outputs**: Reviewing the solutions AI suggests can help you generate both related and divergent ideas. It can serve as a starting point for your own brainstorming sessions.  


### Step into the Client's Shoes

**Identify Concerns**: Understand how users interact with a product or concept. By playing the client, you can pinpoint potential concerns and areas that need refinement.  
**Feedback Loop**: Emulating the client's perspective can give insights into their feedback. This feedback is invaluable for continuous improvement.  

## Clone/Copy Ideas

**Draw Inspiration from Everywhere**: Whether it's the intricate design of a leaf or the flight pattern of birds, nature is brimming with inspiration.  
**Analogies and Metaphors**: Relating your idea to natural phenomena can lead to innovative solutions.  
**SCAMPER Technique**: Especially when using the 'Adapt' component, modify or tweak ideas from other sources (like nature) to fit your specific requirements.  

## Real-world Observation

**Challenge Assumptions**: Witnessing how people interact with a product can debunk myths or assumptions you might have held.  
**Brainstorm from Observations**: Watch, learn, and list! Observing real-time usage can provide a plethora of ideas for refinement or overhaul.  

## Mind Mapping

Kickstart with a central concept and radiate outwards, connecting related ideas. This visual representation not only organizes thoughts but also reveals connections that might have been overlooked. As branches grow and interconnect, you'll find a network of ideas that can be explored further.
